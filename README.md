# stats220

## This is my repo for **STATS 220.**
### *A little about me:*

1. I am undertaking a degree in **compsci**
2. I am taking [**STATS 220**](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1213) because I think it will teach me valuable skills that I will use in the future
3. I am interested in learning about visualising and analysing data! :)
